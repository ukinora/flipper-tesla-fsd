/*
 * fsd_power.h — "did the car cut our power, or did we fall over?"
 *
 * The rear tap gives us CAN, ground and 12V. Whether that 12V is ALWAYS-ON or
 * SWITCHED decides the final install: always-on means the module draws current
 * while the car sleeps, and a module that wakes whenever the car wakes is a
 * failsafe concern of its own.
 *
 * WHY NOT JUST USE A MULTIMETER
 * -----------------------------
 * Because reaching the connector means opening a door, and opening a door wakes
 * the car. The meter would have to be clipped on, read through the glass, and
 * even then it says only "0 V". This says more:
 *
 *   POWERON   the supply went away and came back
 *   BROWNOUT  the supply sagged -- thin wire, bad crimp, e-fuse near its limit
 *   SOFTWARE  we crashed; the supply is not implicated at all
 *
 * Those three want three different responses, and a voltage reading cannot tell
 * them apart.
 *
 * THE TRAP THIS AVOIDS
 * --------------------
 * "Still running after an hour" does NOT mean always-on. It also happens when
 * the car never slept -- sentry left on, a scheduled charge, someone opening
 * the app. So the record carries how long the BUS had been quiet, and a session
 * where the bus never went quiet is reported as inconclusive rather than as a
 * verdict. Answering the wrong question confidently is the failure mode here.
 *
 * PURE. The shim (esp32/.firmware/power_log.cpp) owns NVS, esp_reset_reason()
 * and the clock; this file owns what the numbers mean.
